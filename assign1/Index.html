      <p> I'm showing you five places I plan on visiting in the future.I don't only want to visit these places when I am able to travel but these are the five destinations I want to start with.One of them is Japan.Not only do I love the food but I'm fond of the streetwear.I specifically like the Harajuku look.I want to go to the Dominican Republic to do fun activities like surfing and and other water activities.I must go to Bangladesh since I'm Bengali and my parents are from there.When I go to london, I want to explore the city life and meet all kinds of people.Florida has beautiful weather and I would go there with my friends and explore Miami. What I will be showing are traveling videos for new comers and images of each places. </p>
